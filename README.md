DEV-CSL-UTIL-GNU-C_Scripting_Language
=====================================

CSL is a scripting language with C syntax. At first sight you can hardly distinguish a CSL script from a C/C++ source. CSL is available for Windows, OS/2 and various unix family systems like Linux and BSD. A comprehensive set of libraries is included in the base package and writing your own libraries is possible with an easy API for C programs as well as a class interface for C++ programs. If you are looking for a compact and powerful scripting engine for your application, CSL might be the choise.
